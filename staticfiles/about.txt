The site is based on free template "Clean Blog" from Start Bootstrap. This project focuses on the backend part, but the template has also undergone changes.
This project was created to familiarize with the basics of web development on the Django framework and is the first work for my portfolio. The subject of the site is undefined and is filled with random news or facts.
The following components were used in the project: PostgreSQL, Django Rest Framework(Djoser,token), Postman etc.
